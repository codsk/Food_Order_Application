Hey follow these steps to see application

setp 1: open vs code and clone the application "git clone https://github.com/codsk/Pizzeria_App.git"
setp 2: edit .env file with username and db_password 
step 3: open the thunder client, click new request post method http://localhost:5000/api/orderPizza 
step 4: click new request post method http://localhost:5000/api/customPizza
step 5: in Pizzeria_App open terminal npm run build and npm run start then application will work 

or 

ask me for username and password you can eliminate step 3 and 4
